# Government Securities Investment Platform (InvestInGov)

InvestInGov is a fintech application enabling users to seamlessly invest in government securities, providing real-time data, portfolio management, and secure transaction processing.

What was the selling point? What was I trying to solve?
Securities investments are growing rapidly in Kenya with over 35 billion Kshs invested in the reopening of the treasury bond FXD1/2020/005 dated 19th of February, 2025. Such staggering numbers have not only been as a result of civic education regarding such investements, but ha s also been owed to the introduction of an application (DhowCSD). This platform features access to real-time market data, portfolio management, ability to place bids among other crucial investment processes.

However, this system failed to implement an online in-app transaction system, forcing investors to complete transfers of their funds outside of the system, with some having to go physically to their respective commercial banks. 

This is where InvestInGov comes into play; Integrating the current system functionalities with transaction processing.
